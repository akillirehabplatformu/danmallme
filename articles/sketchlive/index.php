                    <p class="intro">Two weeks ago, I opened <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a> for the first time. Lots of people were raving about it as a great new tool for design, so I wanted to see for myself. I <a href="https://twitter.com/danielmall/status/509717960999849984">tweeted my stream-of-consciousness thoughts</a> for 2 days. Here are the highlights.</p>

                <p class="disclaimer">Disclaimer: this post isn&rsquo;t affiliated with Sketch or Bohemian Coding at all, other than me using the trial version of Sketch 3 for this experiment. Also, my point of comparison is Photoshop, an app I&rsquo;ve used for about 15 years and is the second app I open every morning (after my email client). I&rsquo;ve been on customer advisory boards for new and current Adobe products, but this post and experiment have nothing to do with my affiliation with Adobe. I have never received any compensation from Adobe for endorsing any products, but they did send me a sweet Photoshop pillow once.</p>

                <p>I recently started a new project, redesigning a site for a media company. I learn better when I have an actual project with which to learn the new skill (as opposed to only doing tutorials and theoretical examples), so I dove in head first.

                <p>On day 2, I decided to switch from my current project to a slightly different one. My current project&rsquo;s style guide relies on flat colors and utilitarian typography, which, even in a short day, I&rsquo;m convinced that Sketch is great for designing sites like that. But, one of the reasons I continue to use Photoshop is that it&rsquo;s equally flexible for all types of pixel pushing. Sure, there are features&mdash;like the ones in tools in Sketch&mdash;that would make some tasks much easier to accomplish, but for me to fully switch, I&rsquo;ll need to be able to make a range of outputs with the tool.</p>

                <p>I decided to replicate the <a href="http://www.meetyourmx.com/">Meet Your MX</a> site, expertly designed by <a href="https://twitter.com/brijanp">Brijan Powell</a>. I loved this site from the instant I saw it, because it contains a lot of richness in typographic design, graphic design, and interaction design that I think is missing from a lot of sites nowadays. A good design tool should allow me to design a site like this without much friction. A great design tool should make it easier for me to design a site like this.</p>

                <p>I think I did a decent job with the replication (using a separate model):</p>

                <p>At the end of two days, I thought Sketch did a good job of getting out of my way in designing this interface. However, it didn&rsquo;t really do anything to help me design the interface, at least not any more than Photoshop does. To boot, I do a lot of photo manipulation when I&rsquo;m designing: dodging and burning, layer masks, level corrections, and more. Because Sketch doesn&rsquo;t have these tools&mdash;at least for now&mdash;I still need to rely on Photoshop for them, which means I&rsquo;m jumping back and forth between apps. </p>

                <p>So far, Sketch certainly isn&rsquo;t a Photoshop replacement for me, and, if I&rsquo;m in Photoshop for part of the time, I&rsquo;m having a hard time justifying not being in it all of the time.</p>


                <h2>the #sketchlive aftermath</h2>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve continued to use Sketch for this media company redesign for the last two weeks. There are a few things that I&rsquo;m really liking:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Export tools.</strong> By far the most impressive feature for me. Being able to select any layer or group and hit <kbd>Cmd+Shift+E</kbd> to generate an image&mdash;in lots of resolutions&mdash;and drag it out to anywhere is priceless. And lightning fast to boot? Photoshop&rsquo;s <kbd>Save for Web</kbd> has a lot to learn from Sketch&rsquo;s exporting.</li>
                  <li><strong>Text styles.</strong> Systematic thinking in a graphic design program is welcome. I use this a lot in Photoshop too.</li>
                  <li><strong>File sizes.</strong> Seven full comps in one file with a file size of 6.7MB. My last equivalent PSD was 167MB. </li>
                  <li><strong>Symbols.</strong> I love the idea of resuable elements because it relates to the way I think about developing these designs, but it&rsquo;s taking me a while adopt the practice. I just don&rsquo;t think about it yet. This week, I had to update the footer in all my comps. If I had used symbols, that probably would have been a breeze. But I didn&rsquo;t. So it wasn&rsquo;t.</li>
                  <li><strong>Copy CSS Attributes</strong>, in theory. I haven&rsquo;t built a site that was designed in Sketch, and I won&rsquo;t be building this one myself. TJ Pitre will be building this one, so keep an eye on what he says about it.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Is all that enough to be a Photoshop killer? No. At least not yet. But Sketch definitely has a pretty steady place in the arsenal.</p>
