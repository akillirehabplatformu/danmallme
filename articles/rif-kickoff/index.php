				<p>Last May, I got an email from <a href="http://rif.org/">Reading Is Fundamental</a>, the largest children&rsquo;s literacy nonprofit in the United States, about helping them with a new site. They give free books to kids who need them. I can certainly recall growing up and seeing many of <abbr>RIF</abbr>&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL34A87AFB20262FDE&feature=plcp">great <abbr title="Public Service Announcement">PSA</abbr>s</a> (as I hope you can), so I was really excited to receive a note about working with them. A few conversations later, <a href="http://superfriend.ly/">SuperFriendly</a> and <abbr>RIF</abbr> are embarking on a journey together towards a new site.</p>
                

                <p>It&rsquo;s a great thing when clients are willing to be brave with you. I mentioned in passing that it&rsquo;d be great to design this new site publicly (to borrow <a href="http://chriscoyier.net/2012/09/23/working-in-public/">a phrase from Chris Coyier</a>), as it&rsquo;d be great for both the design community <span class="glue">but&mdash;more</span> <span class="glue">importantly&mdash;also serve</span> <abbr>RIF</abbr> &rsquo;s mission to give away great resources to those who might need them. That also includes other non-profits that might not know what goes into the process of  making a site. Not only did <abbr>RIF</abbr> agree with this notion; they were bursting at the seams to try this for our process together. Win!</p>

                <p>To make sure we can do the best job we can for <abbr>RIF</abbr> and their audience, we&rsquo;ve assembled a dream team of partners to knock this out of the park. <a href="http://kevinmhoffman.com/">Kevin Hoffman</a> will be tackling information architecture and content strategy. <a href="http://esbueno.noahstokes.com/">Noah Stokes</a> and his crew at <a href="http://hellobold.com/">Bold</a> will be coding the front-end and helping <abbr>RIF</abbr> migrate to <a href="http://expressionengine.com/">ExpressionEngine</a>. SuperFriendly will be handling design and overall project management: designer <a href="http://twitter.com/jluciano215">Josh Luciano</a> will be helping to craft an appropriate look and feel, project manager <a href="http://mattecook.com/">Matt Cook</a> will be making sure everything runs smoothly and that all the pieces fit together nicely, and I&rsquo;ll be concentrating on the overall creative direction &amp; strategy to make sure we&rsquo;re making the best possible site for <abbr>RIF</abbr> and that the quality of all of our work is something we can be proud of. Over the next few months, we&rsquo;ll be sharing updates about this project: the good and the not-so-good, the failures and the victories.</p>
                
                <p>First up: the kickoff meeting.</p>


                <h2>Game time</h2>

                <p>We kicked this project off a few weeks ago. The five of us trekked to the <abbr>RIF</abbr> office in Washington D.C. to meet the team and dream together about the new site. Here&rsquo;s the agenda we sent them to prep for the day:</p>

                <p>We prepped together as a team at dinner the night before. Kevin, being <a href="http://goodkickoffmeetings.com/">the meeting guru</a> he is, advised that the schedule looked too tight to be doable, especially the after-lunch sessions. I brushed off his warnings. (He was right.)</p>

                <p>We had a great conversation, especially during the Content Discussion and Design Studio sessions. However, one question kept coming up that still remained unanswered at the end of the Design Studio: what&rsquo;s the right balance of value for the user vs. information about <abbr>RIF</abbr> that should exist on the site? Of course, the <abbr>RIF</abbr> site should be a place where people can learn about the organization and all it does to benefit kids in need. However, people generally don&rsquo;t like being broadcasted at; content on the site needs to provide value to its <span class="glue">audience&mdash;in</span> this case, <span class="glue">parents&mdash;arguably</span> even if it&rsquo;s not about <abbr>RIF</abbr>.</p>

                <p>This was my favorite part of the meeting: knowing that we still didn&rsquo;t have this answer fully solidified, we decided to break the rest of the agenda and instead refocus as much of the rest of the meeting as we could into answering this question and all the details that surrounded it.</p> 

                <p>We decided on 2 new exercises. The first was a discussion about sites that each person in the room used every day and plotted them against sites each person found beautiful. We ended up with a chart that looked like this and discussed in detail where the new site should fall in this spectrum and why:</p>

                <p>We never needed the second exercise. (For the curious, we were planning to do another design studio, solely focused on this question.) I love that our team wasn&rsquo;t afraid to call an audible here; we knew what was important for us to answer that day, and we pulled out all the stops to get it.  I&rsquo;m so grateful to work with a team&mdash;of which I include <abbr>RIF</abbr>&mdash;that has a shared goal of creating the best possible site we can create together.</p>

                <p>We all left that day energized and excited for what&rsquo;s to come. As we make progress, you can bet I&rsquo;ll report back as often as I can. We&rsquo;re knee deep in simultaneously exploring architecture and aesthetics. More on that in the days to come.</p>

                <p>I hope, dear reader, that this has some value for you. By creating this site in public, I hope we can all learn together,  you from us and us from you. I&rsquo;d love to hear from you. What can we be doing better for <abbr>RIF</abbr>? What can we be doing better for you?</p>
